### General description of `iol.py` module

* Low-level I/O classes to facilitate "bare-metal" access in Micropython to STM32 memory locations and device registers (for learning purposes).

* Created on a Pyboard (PYB) v1.1 (with STM32F405RGT6 microcontroller) but should be readily adaptable to other STM32 Micropython builds.

### Getting started

When plugged into the USB port of a computer (using a Micro USB B to USB A lead), the Pyboard is configured to appear as  both:

* An **MSC (Mass Storage Class) device** ⁠— for mounting into the filesystem of the computer as a dedicated drive showing the files in the flash memory of the Pyboard (either its inbuilt flash or an installed MicroSD card)

* A **VCP (Virtual Com Port) device** ⁠— for access via a serial terminal program on the computer to the REPL (Read–Evaluate–Print-Loop) environment on the Pyboard

On the Chromebook, I found that the Pyboard filesystem appeared automatically in the "Files" application a few seconds after inserting the USB connector.  I was then able to access the REPL prompt by installing the Chrome OS [Serial Term](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/serial-term/fnjkimblohniildfepjhejeppenokhie) app and configuring the settings as per the screenshot below:

![Chrome OS Serial Terminal settings for Pyboard](/photos/Chrome%20OS%20Serial%20Terminal%20settings%20for%20Pyboard.png?raw=true "Chrome OS Serial Terminal settings for Pyboard")

To add the `iol.py` module to the Pyboard, copy it from the computer into the top folder of the Pyboard filesystem.  From the REPL environment, it can then be brought into operation after issuing an `import iol` instruction, as shown below:

![Using iol module to access ports directly](/photos/Using%20iol%20module%20to%20access%20ports%20directly.png?raw=true "Using iol module to access ports directly")

**Note:** To avoid possible corruption of the Pyboard filesystem, it is important that the "Eject" operation is performed in the Chrome OS "Files" app before either:

* Disconnecting the USB cable; or
* Pressing the "reset" button on the Pyboard

In general, the "reset" button should be used as a last resort for a "cold start" of the Pyboard ⁠— for example, if the REPL environment has crashed.  In most other cases, it is adequate to perform a "warm start" by issuing a `<CONTROL-D>` on a blank line of the REPL prompt.
